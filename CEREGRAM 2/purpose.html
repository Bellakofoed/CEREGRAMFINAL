    Created in 2016, Ceregram offers something social networking has yet to introduce- showing what's on the inside. The team at Ceregram wanted to create a platform that was unique, and enabled our audience to me honest with their emotions.    Ceregram is mean't for everyone and anyone, specifically for those who are wanting to be more mentally aware online.
